We first extend previous formal learnability results on simple description logics to C-CLASSIC, a description logic expressive enough to be practically useful. We then experimentally evaluate two extensions of a learning algorithm suggested by the formal analysis. The first extension learns C-CLASSIC descriptions from individuals. (The formal results assume that examples are themselves descriptions.) The second extension learns disjunctions of C-CLASSIC descriptions from individuals. The experiments, which were conducted using several hundred target concepts from a number of domains, indicate that both extensions reliably learn complex natural concepts."

We investigate an extensive number of such unsupervised measures, using several distributional semantic models that differ by context type and feature weighting. We analyze the performance of the different methods based on their linguistic motivation. Comparison to the state-of-the-art supervised methods shows that while supervised methods generally outperform the unsupervised ones, the former are sensitive to the distribution of training instances, hurting their reliability. Being based on general linguistic hypotheses and independent from training data, unsupervised measures are more robust, and therefore are still useful artillery for hypernymy detection.",

While previous embeddings have shown limitations on prototypical hypernyms, HyperVec represents an unsupervised measure where embeddings are learned in a specific order and capture the hypernym{--}hyponym distributional hierarchy. Moreover, our model is able to generalize over unseen hypernymy pairs, when using only small sets of training data, and by mapping to other languages. Results on benchmark datasets show that HyperVec outperforms both state-of-the-art unsupervised measures and embedding models on hypernymy detection and directionality, and on predicting graded lexical entailment.",

abstract="Building a domain ontology usually requires several resources of different types, e.g. thesaurus, object taxonomies, terminologies, databases, sets of documents, etc, where objects are described in terms of attributes and relations with other objects. One important and hard problem is to be able to combine and merge knowledge units extracted from these different resources within an homogeneous formal representation (such as a description logic or OWL). The purpose of this article is to show which kinds of resources should be available for designing a real-world ontology in a given application domain, and then how Formal Concept Analysis and its extension - Relational Concept Analysis- can be used for materializing an associated ontology. This resulting target ontology can then be encoded within OWL or a description logic formalism, allowing classification-based reasoning. A real-world example in microbiology is detailed. Finally, an evaluation including tests on recall and precision shows how source resources can be completed with other existing domain resources using a semi-automatic analysis process.",
