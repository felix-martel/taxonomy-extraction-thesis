abstract="Knowledge graphs are crucial assets for tasks like query answering or data integration. These tasks can be viewed as reasoning problems, which in turn require efficient reasoning systems to be implemented. To this end, we present VLog, a rule-based reasoner designed to satisfy the requirements of modern use cases, with a focus on performance and adaptability to different scenarios. We address the former with a novel vertical storage layout, and the latter by abstracting the access to data sources and providing a platform-independent Java API. Features of VLog include fast Datalog materialisation, support for reasoning with existential rules, stratified negation, and data integration from a variety of sources, such as high-performance RDF stores, relational databases, CSV files, OWL ontologies, and remote SPARQL endpoints.",

We first extend previous formal learnability results on simple description logics to C-CLASSIC, a description logic expressive enough to be practically useful. We then experimentally evaluate two extensions of a learning algorithm suggested by the formal analysis. The first extension learns C-CLASSIC descriptions from individuals. (The formal results assume that examples are themselves descriptions.) The second extension learns disjunctions of C-CLASSIC descriptions from individuals. The experiments, which were conducted using several hundred target concepts from a number of domains, indicate that both extensions reliably learn complex natural concepts."

abstract="A core requirement for the usage of ontologies within enterprizes is the availability of proved and tested techniques which guarantee an efficient engineering of high-quality ontologies, be that by reuse, manual building or automatic knowledge acquisition. Besides feasible technological support this includes in equal measure integrating ontology engineering within the more general framework of enterprize information architectures, and taking into account the economics of ontology engineering projects, in particular issues of cost effectiveness and profitability. This chapter addresses these two aspects. We discuss the role of ontology engineering in the context of enterprize architectures, arguing for the importance of cost-related measures as decision support in planning and controlling. Then we analyze approaches for reliably assessing the costs of building ontologies, and the usage of cost-related information to quantifiably support decisions arising during the life cycle of an ontology and to optimize the operation of associated processes. We account for the similarities and differences between software and ontology engineering in order to establish the appropriateness of applying methods with a long-standing tradition in this adjacent engineering field to ontologies. Building upon the results of this analysis we introduce ONTOCOM as the first cost model for ontologies and discuss different methods to improve its accuracy for a wide range of ontology engineering projects at public and corporate level.",

Due to the exponential search space, rule mining approaches still have difficulties to scale to today's large KBs. In this paper, we present AMIE 3, a system that employs a number of sophisticated pruning strategies and optimizations. This allows the system to mine rules on large KBs in a matter of minutes. Most importantly, we do not have to resort to approximations or sampling, but are able to compute the exact confidence and support of each rule. Our experiments on DBpedia, YAGO, and Wikidata show that AMIE 3 beats the state of the art by a factor of more than 15 in terms of runtime.",

Three main features distinguish Text2Onto from our earlier framework TextToOnto as well as other state-of-the-art ontology learning frameworks. First, by representing the learned knowledge at a meta-level in the form of instantiated modeling primitives within a so called Probabilistic Ontology Model (POM), we remain independent of a concrete target language while being able to translate the instantiated primitives into any (reasonably expressive) knowledge representation formalism. Second, user interaction is a core aspect of Text2Onto and the fact that the system calculates a confidence for each learned object allows to design sophisticated visualizations of the POM. Third, by incorporating strategies for data-driven change discovery, we avoid processing the whole corpus from scratch each time it changes, only selectively updating the POM according to the corpus changes instead. Besides increasing efficiency in this way, it also allows a user to trace the evolution of the ontology with respect to the changes in the underlying corpus.",

We investigate an extensive number of such unsupervised measures, using several distributional semantic models that differ by context type and feature weighting. We analyze the performance of the different methods based on their linguistic motivation. Comparison to the state-of-the-art supervised methods shows that while supervised methods generally outperform the unsupervised ones, the former are sensitive to the distribution of training instances, hurting their reliability. Being based on general linguistic hypotheses and independent from training data, unsupervised measures are more robust, and therefore are still useful artillery for hypernymy detection.",

While previous embeddings have shown limitations on prototypical hypernyms, HyperVec represents an unsupervised measure where embeddings are learned in a specific order and capture the hypernym{--}hyponym distributional hierarchy. Moreover, our model is able to generalize over unseen hypernymy pairs, when using only small sets of training data, and by mapping to other languages. Results on benchmark datasets show that HyperVec outperforms both state-of-the-art unsupervised measures and embedding models on hypernymy detection and directionality, and on predicting graded lexical entailment.",

abstract="Building a domain ontology usually requires several resources of different types, e.g. thesaurus, object taxonomies, terminologies, databases, sets of documents, etc, where objects are described in terms of attributes and relations with other objects. One important and hard problem is to be able to combine and merge knowledge units extracted from these different resources within an homogeneous formal representation (such as a description logic or OWL). The purpose of this article is to show which kinds of resources should be available for designing a real-world ontology in a given application domain, and then how Formal Concept Analysis and its extension - Relational Concept Analysis- can be used for materializing an associated ontology. This resulting target ontology can then be encoded within OWL or a description logic formalism, allowing classification-based reasoning. A real-world example in microbiology is detailed. Finally, an evaluation including tests on recall and precision shows how source resources can be completed with other existing domain resources using a semi-automatic analysis process.",
